: '

Runs clang-tidy on the code in src/

Return `1` if there are files automatically fixed by clang-tidy.

Returns `0` if no fixes by clang-tidy.

TODO: should also return non-zero if clang-tidy emits warnings
or errors about things it cannot automatically fix. However I cannot
figure out how to get this working yet as it seems that clang-tidy
always returns 0 even on errors.
