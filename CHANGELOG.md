## 3.6.1

Updated for a fix associated with mapnik-vector-tile where images could be requested that would have a width or height of zero resulting
in exceptions.

Several fixes associated with different mapnik by updating to use 3.0.14. Please see mapnik change log for specifics. In
general note worthy changes from mapnik include stricter geojson parsing, fixes for raster plugin, fixes to image scaling,
changing the meaning of filter-factor, and improvements to the the TIFF decoder.

Due to changes in the mapnik core version during this update you should see some changes in the image rescaling of raster and gdal plugin source data. This will definitely change the expected output. This is due to fixes in long standing bugs in the mapnik library.

- Updated to use `font_engine` `instance()` method explicitely, reflecting on changes brought by [3688](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/pull/3688)

## 3.6.0

This release has major performance and stability improvements.

The biggest change is the move to https://github.com/mapbox/wagyu for clipping polygons, which is faster and results in more robust results than the previous implementation based off the "clipper" http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php. The "clipper" was known to hang on very large polygons and could output self-intersecting polygons.

The second largest change is the update of all major C/C++ dependencies. The changelogs for each are listed below. The highlights are 1) the performance improvements in webp 1.6.0, 2) the many crashes fixed in harfbuzz (https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/issues/139), and critical security bugs fixed in libpng, libjpeg, and libtiff.

The third most important set of changes were to node-mapnik directly: for performance many functions now can premultiply as part of another async operation (to avoid needing an additional threadpool access for async premultiply - this matters under load when the threadpool may be full since access can block). And many functions that allocate images now protect from extreme allocation that could hang a machine and result in OOM. Additionally the address sanitizer caught several cases of undefined behavior.

## 3.5.0

This is a major update and reflects a large number of changes added into node-mapnik due to update of the [Mapbox Vector Tile Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec). As part of this the [mapnik-vector-tile library](https://github.com/mapbox/mapnik-vector-tile) was updated to `1.0.0`. Therefore, a large number of interfaces changes have taken place around the `mapnik.VectorTile` object.

It is important to know that the concept of `width` and `height` have been removed from `mapnik.VectorTile` objects. This is replaced by the concept of `tileSize`. While `width` and `height` were based on the concept of an Image size created from a vector tile, `tileSize` is directly related to the `extent` as defined in the `Layer` of a vector tile. For understanding what the `Layer` and `extent` is please see the [Vector Tile Specification](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/tree/master/2.1#41-layers). This also changed the `buffer_size` arguments that were commonly used in many Vector Tile methods, which was also based on the *Image size*. The vector tile object now contains a `bufferSize` which represents the buffer added to the layer extent in a tile.

Internally, all methods now depend on V2 tiles, however, any V1 tiles that are loaded into a `mapnik.VectorTile` object will **automatically** be updated.

Summary of changes:

 - `mapnik.VectorTile.addData` now verifies buffers validity and internally updates v1 tiles to v2
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.addDataSync` now verifies buffers validity and internally updates v1 tiles to v2
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.setData` now verifies buffers validity and internally updates v1 tiles to v2
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.setDataSync` now verifies buffers validity and internally updates v1 tiles to v2
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.addImage` now takes a `mapnik.Image` object rather then a buffer, it also takes optional arguments image_scaling and image_format.
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.addImageBuffer` replaces the old functionality of of `mapnik.VectorTile.addImage`
 - Added `mapnik.VectorTile.addImageSync` and made `mapnik.VectorTile.addImage` accept a callback.
 - Added `mapnik.VectorTile.addImageBufferSync` and made `mapnik.VectorTile.addImageBuffer` accept a callback.
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.height()` method is removed
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.width()` method is removed
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.parse()` method is removed
 - `mapnik.VectorTile.IsSolid()` method is removed
 - `mapnik.shutdown()` is removed
 - Removed the dependency on libprotobuf library
 - Lowered memory requirements for vector tile creation and vector tile operations.
 - Duplicate layer names in `mapnik.VectorTile` objects are no longer permitted.
 - Added new `mapnik.VectorTile.extent()` method which returns the bounding box of a tile in EPSG:3857
 - Added new `mapnik.VectorTile.bufferedExtent()` method which returns the bounding box including buffer of a tile in EPSG:3857
 - Added new `mapnik.VectorTile.emptyLayers()` method which returns the name of layers which were not added to a tile during any tile rendering operation.
 - Added new `mapnik.VectorTile.paintedLayers()` method which returns the name of layers which were considered painted during rendering or layers that contain data.
 - Added new `mapnik.VetorTile.tileSize` property.
 - Added new `mapnik.VetorTile.bufferSize` property.
 - Updated many of the default configuration options on `mapnik.VectorTile` class methods
 - Removed the concept of `path_multiplier` from the code entirely.
 - Added optional arguments of `tile_size` and `buffer_size` to `mapnik.VectorTile` constructor.

Notable Changes in Mapnik v3.0.10 include:

 - A shapefile index now is skipped instead of causing an error to be throw. The shapefile plugin will then
   proceed by reading without using an index. It is advisable to regenerate the indexes to maintain
   top performance.

Notable changes in the Mapnik SDK include:

 - sqlite 3100000->3110000
 - libpng 1.6.20->1.6.21

   - Fixed premultiplication bug in raster encoding (#170)
 - Binaries updated to use Mapnik v3.0.9-48-gbb8cd10 and mapnik-packaging@039aa0d

Notable Changes in Mapnik v3.0.9-48-gbb8cd10 include:

 - BREAKING: any `.index` files accompanying a `.shp` must now be regenerated otherwise
   an error will be throw like `Error: invalid index file`. To avoid this error you can
   either delete the existing `.index` files, or ideally run `shapeindex` (or [mapnik-shapeindex.js](https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik/blob/master/bin/mapnik-shapeindex.js)) to recreate the `.index`.
   The trigger for this change was an optimization that required a new binary format for the shapefile indexes (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/pull/3217). It was a mistake of @springmeyer to bring this into node-mapnik minor release (I'm sorry).
 - WARNING: index files generated with this newer Mapnik are invalid for older versions of Mapnik.

## 3.4.10

 - Now bundling the `mapnik-index` command (https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik/pull/545)
 - Added `process_all_rings`  option to `VectorTile.composite`, `VectorTile.addGeoJSON`, and `Map.render`.
   This option enables invalid ring to be processed (and potentially kept during re-encoding) when creating vector tiles.
   By default this is set to `false`. Use with caution.
 - Added enum for all polygon fill types under `mapnik.polygonFillType`. Options are `nonZero`, `evenOdd`, `positive`,
   and `negative`
 - Added `fill_type`  option to `VectorTile.composite`, `VectorTile.addGeoJSON`, and `Map.render`. By default
   this is set to `mapnik.polygonFillType.nonZero`
 - Added `multi_polygon_union`  option to `VectorTile.composite`, `VectorTile.addGeoJSON`, and `Map.render`. By
   default this is set to `true`. This will cause multipolygons to undergo a union operation during vector tile
   creation.
 - Added `simplify_distance`  option to `VectorTile.composite`.
 - Added `max_extent` (bbox) option to `VectorTile.composite`. By default it is unset which means no
   clipping extent will be used for the operation. If provided the data will be restricted to this extent.
     - Landed in https://github.com/mapnik/node-mapnik/commit/ef3b12a36f529a1a8fbb70f4ddd6a92e1bd22008
     - Previously compositing was using a hardcoded global extent of `-20037508.34,-20037508.34,20037508.34,20037508.34` which meant that all vector tile data was being clipped to global extents. This was harmless in all cases except when data contained data outside of global extents intentionally in order to avoid rendering of lines and blurs being visible at tile boundaries.
 - Added `reencode` (boolean) option to `VectorTile.composite`. If `true` will trigger re-rendering
   even if the z/x/y of all tiles matches. If `false` (the default) then tiles will be concatenated for
   best performance.
 - Updated mapnik-vector-tile to `v0.14.1`
 - Binaries updated to use Mapnik v3.0.9-rc2 and mapnik-packaging@6f2f178

Notable Changes in Mapnik 3.0.9-rc2/3.0.8 include:

 - Updated to use mapnik-vector-tile `0.12.0`

Notable Changes in Mapnik 3.0.5 include:
 - PostGIS plugin: added `key_field_as_attribute` option. Defaults to `True` to preserve current behavior of having the `key_field` added both
   as an attribute and as the `feature.id` value. If `key_field_as_attribute=false` is passed then the attribute is discarded (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/3115)
 - CSV plugin has been further optimized and has gained experimental support for on-disk indexes (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/3089)
 - SVG parser now fallsback to using `viewbox` if explicit dimensions are lacking (https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/issues/3081)

   be used very carefully as the lifetime of the Image object is tied to that of the Buffer. If the
   buffer object is garbage collect this could result in a segfault.

Notable Changes in Mapnik 3.0.5 include:

## 1.1.3

 - Gyp binding cleanups
 - Removed direct icu::UnicodString usage to ensure robust compiles against icu build with `-DUSING_ICU_NAMESPACE=0`

 - Disabled default debug symbol generation to speed up builds

## 1.1.2

 - Upgraded to mapnik-vector-tile 3.0.x API

## 1.1.1

 - Fixed extent of vector::tile_datasource to be sensitive to map buffer (TODO - long term
   plan is to make extent optional instead of adding support for layer specific buffered extent) - this is needed for avoiding too restrictive filtering of features at render time.
 - Fixed exception handling when creating geojson from vector tile
 - Build fixes to support python 3.x
 - Now accepting `scale_denominator`, `scale`, and `format` in options passed to `map.RenderSync`

## 1.1.0

 - Fixed missing exception translation for MemoryDatasource and Image constructors
 - Fixed invalid default for `scale` in `map.render`
 - Implemented mapnik.Image.fromBytes (#147)

## 1.0.0
 - Dropped support for Mapnik versions older than v2.2.0
 - Moved build system to node-gyp - now supports node v0.10.x
 - Fonts are not longer auto-registered. Call `mapnik.register_default_fonts()` to register "DejaVu" set
   that is often bundled by Mapnik and call `mapnik.register_system_fonts()` to register fonts are various
   known system paths.
 - New mapnik.VectorTile API
